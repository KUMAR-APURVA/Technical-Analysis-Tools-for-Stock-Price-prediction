# Technical-Analysis-Tools-for-Stock-Price-prediction
Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify 
trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, 
such as price movement and volume.
Technical analysis tools are used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a 
security will affect changes in price, volume and implied volatility. Technical analysis is 
often used to generate short-term trading signals from various charting tools, but can 
also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the 
broader market or one of its sectors.

In this project we have focused on 4 different Technical analysis tools namely MACD, RSI, Bollinger Band and Fibonacci Retracement\ for Stock Price Prediction. We implemented the python code corresponding to these tools. We used the data of Apple.inc .
